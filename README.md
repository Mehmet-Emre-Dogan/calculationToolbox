Some useful tools for engineers/engineering students.
# Linear Interpolator
Find the middle point y0 by using x1, x0, x2, y1, y2. Also, it works for the cases one of the endpoints is unknown instead of the middle point, namely extrapolation.
# Coordinate Converters
Converts cartesian, cylindrical, and spherical coordinates to each other. Note that the vector names of the cylindrical and spherical coordinates may change book to book. So, please go over the coordinates.png, and make the necessary changes to the script to be compatible with your book. Use precision.txt to set the number of decimal points in answers.
